# Floki
This now gives you the option for subdomains and directories. While it lists all active and inactive links as well as the server code and color coded. Now includes the ability to scan tor sites (in beta) so I will be updating that as needed.

Besure to run pip install -r requirements.txt 

then run python3 floki.py and go from there!
