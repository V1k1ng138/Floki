# Floki
Rebuild of Simple Subdomain Finder


Didn't know if I wanted to keep it or make something new. Decided to make it its own. This now gives you the option for subdomains and directories. While it lists all active and inactive links as well as the server code and color coded.

Besure to run pip install -r requirements.txt 

then run python3 floki.py and go from there!
